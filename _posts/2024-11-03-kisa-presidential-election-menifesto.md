# Munim for KISA President

Hello everyone! My name is **Munim**, and I’m running for KISA President because I believe that KAIST should be a place where every international student feels welcome, supported, and connected. My goal is to address the unique challenges we face and make our student life easier, more fulfilling, and more enjoyable. Here’s my plan:

---

## 1. Clear and Accessible Dietary Information 

Eating on campus should be a stress-free experience, but the lack of clear dietary restriction information is a major issue. Currently, food labels and dietary guidelines are often available only in Korean, and even when they’re in English, details about allergens or dietary restrictions are inconsistent.  

### My Solution:
- **Work closely with the campus dining and customer service teams** to ensure clear and detailed dietary restriction information is available in both English and Korean at all campus cafeterias.
- **Create a guideline for food labels** that covers common dietary needs (e.g., vegan, halal, kosher, gluten-free) to make eating safe and accessible for everyone.

By ensuring that dietary information is accurate and available in English, I want to make sure everyone can dine with confidence, knowing their dietary needs are respected and understood.

## 2. Better Internship Opportunities for International Students

Right now, international students are only allowed to take on **2-month internships**, which limits our ability to gain valuable work experience and build career connections in Korea. Many students would like to pursue **longer (6-month) internships or co-op programs**, but these are not currently options for international students at KAIST.

### My Solution:
- **Advocate for policy changes** that would allow international students to pursue longer internships and co-ops across all departments.
- **Collaborate with university administration and career services** to make these opportunities more accessible, so that every international student can get a fair shot at valuable industry experience.

I want to work towards a future where international students have the same career-building opportunities as their peers.

## 3. Introducing a Study Mates Program

Studying with a study mate can make a huge difference. Having someone in your course to discuss assignments, share ideas, and collaborate with can help make learning more enjoyable and effective. Plus, having a buddy system before course selection can make it easier to choose classes together.

### My Solution:
- **Create a study mate program** where students taking the same course can connect with each other for better collaboration and support.
- **Launch a pre-course buddy matching system** that allows students to talk with each other about courses before the application period, so they can make more informed choices with friends.

This program will help students not only succeed academically but also build connections with their peers.

## 4. Monthly Open Meetings to Strengthen Communication

Right now, many students feel disconnected from KISA and the issues being worked on. I believe KISA should actively engage with the community to address this. By holding **monthly open meetings**, we can directly connect with the international student body, share updates, and listen to everyone’s ideas and concerns.

### My Solution:
- **Host open meetings** (similar to “Tuesday Talks”) every month where students can come, ask questions, give feedback, and hear about KISA’s ongoing work.
- **Ensure transparency and regular updates** on issues affecting students, so everyone feels they are part of the conversation and that KISA truly represents them.

These open meetings will help KISA stay grounded and in tune with the needs and concerns of international students.

## 5. Career Counseling in English

Planning for a career is challenging, and it’s even harder without proper support. Currently, there’s a lack of **one-on-one career counseling sessions in English**, which makes it difficult for international students to get the guidance they need for internships, job applications, and long-term planning.

### My Solution:
- **Work with career services to set up dedicated English-language counseling sessions** where students can receive individualized feedback and advice.
- **Provide a supportive space** for international students to discuss their career aspirations, options, and potential paths with knowledgeable counselors.

This service will empower students to make informed choices about their futures and feel more confident about their career direction.

---

## 6. Department and Career Information Sessions for International Students

While there are department introductions in classes like HCL and ECL, they’re often tailored to Korean students and don’t address the specific concerns of international students.

### My Solution:
- **Organize department introductions and career info sessions specifically for international students** that cover key information and address common concerns for newcomers.
- **Tailor these sessions** to the needs of international students to help them navigate academic and career pathways more confidently.

By giving new students a better understanding of their departments and career options, we can help them start their journeys at KAIST with clarity and confidence.

## 7. Social and Recreational Activities on Weekends

Weekends should be a time to unwind, relax, and connect with others. However, international students often lack regular, organized social activities where they can meet new friends and enjoy their time outside of academics.

### My Solution:
- **Organize a range of weekend activities**, including movie nights, board game and card game tournaments, cooking or baking sessions, photography walks, trivia nights, book or podcast clubs, sports days, karaoke nights, and skill exchange workshops.
- **Create a supportive, engaging social scene** where students can bond, have fun, and make memories together.

These activities will provide an essential outlet for relaxation and community-building, helping international students feel more at home at KAIST.

## In Summary

I’m committed to making KAIST a place where every international student feels represented, supported, and connected. My goal as KISA President will be to address practical issues, create opportunities for growth, and foster a strong sense of community for all of us. Let’s build a KAIST that’s more inclusive, empowering, and enjoyable together. I’d be honored to have your support!

Thank you for reading, and let’s work together to make these ideas a reality.
